### Goal 
*****

The overall goal of this project is to create an agent-based model (ABM) of interconnected engineered, military systems that interact with one another in addition to a heterogeneous environment and an unpredictable enemy threat. Furthermore, I seek to gain a normative understanding through evaluation of various network configurations, functional allocations, and system behaviors that best lead to the desired emergence of resilience in this system-of-systems.

&nbsp;  
### Justification
****

ABM is the modeling approach for this system under study. Each node in the network represents an individual, intelligent military system and acts independently and collectively to achieve a desired outcome. The environment in which these systems operate is often unknown and heterogeneous. The threats that these systems encounter are often unknown and heterogeneous as well. Based on these system characteristics and the desire to evaluate the emergence of higher level behavior forms a strong case for choosing ABM as the modeling approach.




&nbsp; 
### Main Micro-level Processes and Macro-level Dynamics of Interest
****

_Short overview of the key processes and/or relationships you are interested in using your model to explore. Will likely be something regarding emergent behavior that arises from individual interactions_

&nbsp; 


## Model Outline
****
&nbsp; 
### 1) Environment
_Description of the environment in your model. Things to specify *if they apply*:_

* _Boundary conditions (e.g. wrapping, infinite, etc.)_
* _Dimensionality (e.g. 1D, 2D, etc.)_
* _List of environment-owned variables (e.g. resources, states, roughness)_
* _List of environment-owned methods/procedures (e.g. resource production, state change, etc.)_


```python
# Include first pass of the code you are thinking of using to construct your environment
# This may be a set of "patches-own" variables and a command in the "setup" procedure, a list, an array, or Class constructor
# Feel free to include any patch methods/procedures you have. Filling in with pseudocode is ok! 
# NOTE: If using Netlogo, remove "python" from the markdown at the top of this section to get a generic code block
```

&nbsp; 

### 2) Agents
 
 _Description of the "agents" in the system. Things to specify *if they apply*:_
 
* _List of agent-owned variables (e.g. age, heading, ID, etc.)_
* _List of agent-owned methods/procedures (e.g. move, consume, reproduce, die, etc.)_


```python
# Include first pass of the code you are thinking of using to construct your agents
# This may be a set of "turtle-own" variables and a command in the "setup" procedure, a list, an array, or Class constructor
# Feel free to include any agent methods/procedures you have so far. Filling in with pseudocode is ok! 
# NOTE: If using Netlogo, remove "python" from the markdown at the top of this section to get a generic code block
```

&nbsp; 

### 3) Action and Interaction 
 
**_Interaction Topology_**

_Description of the topology of who interacts with whom in the system. Perfectly mixed? Spatial proximity? Along a network? CA neighborhood?_
 
**_Action Sequence_**

_What does an agent, cell, etc. do on a given turn? Provide a step-by-step description of what happens on a given turn for each part of your model_

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Etc...

&nbsp; 
### 4) Model Parameters and Initialization

_Describe and list any global parameters you will be applying in your model._

_Describe how your model will be initialized_

_Provide a high level, step-by-step description of your schedule during each "tick" of the model_

&nbsp; 

### 5) Assessment and Outcome Measures

_What quantitative metrics and/or qualitative features will you use to assess your model outcomes?_

&nbsp; 

### 6) Parameter Sweep

_What parameters are you most interested in sweeping through? What value ranges do you expect to look at for your analysis?_
